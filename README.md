## fork source 

* implot demos

forked from below:
This repository contains toy [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) applications that demonstrate some of the library's functionality. The demos here are more sophisticated than those provided in `implot_demo.h`, and may rely on third-party libraries that would otherwise clutter ImPlot's main repository. Use these examples as a starting point for your application and to familiarize yourself with ImPlot, but do not assume all code (e.g. signal processing algorithms) to be perfectly correct or optimal.
